# PixelBrowser
Incredibly janky browser that is planned to fully implement HTML/FCSS and C# as frontend.

## The Plan:
Use SDL2 and C to handle rendering and all that. The HTML and FCSS gets passed on to the FCSS compiler to then output JSON for the renderer to read. As for C#, there will be an already-made C# executable that takes C# script as a string to then dynamically run it. (Still investigating C#)
